					I first heard about FIRST from a coworker. At the time, we both worked at computer maker Compaq and our local office helped sponsor his son's FIRST team from High Tech High School. In appreciation for the sponsorship, the team came into our office and presented that year's challenge, described the robot they had constructed, and gave us a general introduction to FIRST. That year the NJ Regionals were being held at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and I brought my daughters Alex and Erin to see the competition. That was over 10 years ago. Alex was eight years old at the time and Erin 6.

Fast forward 10 years. My wife re-enters the workforce as a teacher first at Hightstown High School and then at the new Robbinsville High School. She heard about FIRST from her Hightstown High co-worker Chris Gregory, senior mentor for Team 1089. Chris encouraged and supported her starting a Robbinsville FIRST team which she did for the 2008 season. Team Nemesis, 2590 was born with no small effort from team 1089 senior mentors, Michael and Sara Reffler.

Daughters Alex and Erin, both now in college, were members of the team that year. I joined as a mentor, and daughter Kiera, although still in grade school, helped wherever and whenever possible. The rest is history!</div>
