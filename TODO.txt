TODO || Manual Labor || Coders
(Non code tasks will be marked with ***)


=================
1.) display Page Loading symbol if images aren't loaded on front page

4.) Robot's Record should display on sidebar of Robot page
=================
5.) Sorting Options on the Members page
	- By "type" (mentor, alumni, member)
	- by "team" (build, software, finance, marketing)
	- by "usefulness?" (mrs. wolfe wants her own arbitrary sort order)
		- will need extra "usefulness" field for members
		
	- switch out the current page and a "new" members-container with
	  the new sorting functions/php display functions with the current one
	  with a CSS3 "fade in" effect.
	  
	- Does the scrolling make you sick??

		- the google site one is kinda wonky, (look into formatting?)
