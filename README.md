How to contribute::

1. Fork the repository and clone it onto your desktop
2. Open and edit in Notepad++ or your text editor of choice
3. Preview your changes in Chrome, Firefox, Safarai and optionally Opera
  * the "inspect element" option in Chrome/Firefox is an excellent way to test/examine your html/css
4. After you've tested your changes, and are confident in their accuracy make a pull request

make sure to set an "upstream" variable (that is me, alexiswolfish/frc2590-website.git) and fetch updates
from it on the reg, since I'll be constantly updating this space with new pages.
